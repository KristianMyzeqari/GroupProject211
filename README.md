# GroupProject211
Here we will store all of the work we do for the 211 labs/projects

Quick summary on File/Folder organization
1. We can split up every single lab/project in it's own folder
2. For labs/projects split in subteams, I will create a directory for each subteam, being a parent directory for the work you will upload.
3. Avoid using spaces for directory names!!!!!
4. Remember to pull new changes before adding your changes!
